# Assignments and Grading

Continuous assessment will be used for this course---there is no final exam. Grades will be allocated as follows:

* 20% in total for your group homework assignments;
* 30% for your 25 minute final project group presentation (20%) and supporting material (10%), see below;
* 40% for a set of weekly homework assignments as described in the [syllabus](/syllabus-remote.html) which take the form of exercises, tests, or essays. These are retrospective and will reflect on the lessons learned from the previous class;
* 10% for a 1,000 word long essay.

# Group work

You will be put into groups at the beginning of the class. In your group you will do a series of group assignments and a project.

## Final Project

As part of your group, you will build a business and test multiple hypotheses to validate your business model. As part of the work for Unit 2, everybody in the class will come up with their own business idea. Once the Unit 2 assignment is completed, students should come together in their groups and decide on a business idea as a group (perhaps using the individual business ideas as a starting point).

In Unit 4, we discuss how to take an experimental approach to product development, and how to design and test product hypotheses. Following the Unit 4 assignment, you will design and test product hypotheses for your business idea and then test them with real people outside your class, and to evolve your business idea (and potentially pivot) based on what you learn.

In your final presentation (see below) you'll present the your business model and product canvases, and describe the experiments you performed, what you learned, and the decisions you made as a result. Teams must describe at least three experiments in order to have a chance to achieve the highest grade.

10% of your final grade is for the supporting material for your final project:

* A completed and up-to-date business model canvas, value proposition canvas, proto-personas, and empathy maps (4 points);
* Documentation for each experiment, including hypothesis, expected result, description of experiment, results, and what you decided based on the results (2 points per experiment).

**About halfway through the semester (the date will be announced on bCourses), your business model canvas, value proposition canvas, proto-personas, empathy maps, and the documentation for your first experiment must be submitted. You will receive 6 points based on this submission. (Note: you are free to change your business model following this submission if your experiment shows the business model will not work.)**

## Group project final presentation

Your group is responsible for recording your final presentation and submitting it by the final project due date.

Presentation Guidelines:

* The presentation should last no more than 20 minutes.
* All group members must speak or have a role to play during the presentation.
* Slide decks must also be submitted too.

The presentation, representing 20% of your final grade, will be assessed according to the following criteria:

* Content (5 pts) - Did the presentation have valuable material that
  was relevant and beneficial to the class? Was it able to
  sufficiently address what was required by the prompt?
* Organization (5 pts) - Was the presentation well-structured,
  well-prepared and easy to follow?
* Delivery (5 pts) - Was the manner in which the presentation was
  delivered engaging enough, with sufficient confidence and
  preparedness?
* Participation (5 pts) - Did all team members contribute to the
  presentation and collaborate well with the team? (assessed by peer review)
