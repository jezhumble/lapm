# Assignments and Grading

Continuous assessment will be used for this course---there is no final exam. Grades will be allocated as follows:

* 40% In-class participation + Group Presentation
  * 20% for attendance
  * 20% for one 15-minute group presentation. Group presentations provide an opportunity for the class to be exposed to real-world examples or in-depth explorations of techniques related to the topic being discussed for the week. Please see the Group Presentations page for more information.
* 60% Weekly Assignments + Essays. Weekly assignments will always be due on Sundays at 11:59pm. 
  * 15% each for two 800-word essays
  * 30% for a set of weekly assignments (can be exercises, quizzes, or short essays). These are retrospective and will reflect on the lessons learned from the previous class.
