# Assignments and Grading

Continuous assessment will be used for this course---there is no final exam. Grades will be allocated as follows:

* 40% In-class participation + group presentation
  * 20% for attendance
  * 20% for one 15 minute group presentation. Group presentations provide an opportunity for the class to be exposed to real-world examples or in-depth explorations of techniques related to the topic being discussed for the week. Please see the Group Presentations page for more information.
* 60% Weekly Assignments + Essays. Weekly assignments will always be due on Sundays at 11:59pm. 
  * 15% each for two 800-word essays
  * 30% for a set of weekly assignments as described in the
    [syllabus](/syllabus.html) which take the form of either
    exercises or short essays. These are retrospective and will
    reflect on the lessons learned from the previous class.

## Long essays

Long essays are assessed according to the following rubric:

* Structure of your arguments
* Synthesis of reference material
* Response to all aspects of the prompt

### First long essay

The first long essay is structured for you to share your understanding of how the modern approach to product development has been shaped by forces in industry and how the lean/agile practices used have developed in response to these forces.

You will be writing one ~800 word essay but structured in two parts:

* **Part 1**: Based on what we've learned in class, what are the key forces (socio-economic, technological, etc.) that have driven the lean/agile approach to product development in the past two decades? (~250 words)
* **Part 2**: Consider several lean-agile practices we have discussed in the past 5 weeks that you find most relevant to your interests. Which of them would you want to apply most in your next job? What trade-offs do these practices make in order to effectively harness the forces you identified in Part 1? What are their limitations? What are the obstacles to implementing them? (~550 words)

Make sure to cite *at least 3 of the references* that have been provided in the [syllabus](/syllabus.html) in crafting your response. You may use external references beyond the 3 that are required. Use MLA or APA citation; in-text citations, footnotes or bibliography style are acceptable.

### Second long essay

The second long essay is structured for you to share your understanding of the role of a product manager in a lean/agile product development environment.

You will be writing one ~800 word essay, structured in two parts:

* **Part 1**: Based on what we've learned in class from our guest speakers and from the lectures, articulate the mission of a product manager in a software product organization. What are the key measures to assess a product manager's success, and what core skills does one need to employ to succeed in a lean/agile environment? (~500 words)
* **Part 2**: In the context of what you've learned about product management, what do you think is your biggest gap in becoming an effective product manager? What can you do to close this gap? (~300 words)

Make sure to cite *at least 2 of the guest lectures* and *at least one of the references* that are in the syllabus in crafting your response. You may use external references beyond these 3 that are required. Use MLA or APA citation; in-text citations, footnotes or bibliography style are acceptable.

## Presentations

The goal of the group presentation is to provide the class with
multiple perspectives on the topic for the week---whether in
the form of real-world examples based on the experience of
participants, or their exploration and research of product management
techniques, processes or tools.

The presentations are not just an opportunity for participants to
demonstrate their skill in research, collaboration, and delivering
presentations. They are also an important source of learning for the
rest of the class.

Presentation Guidelines:

* The group will have 15 minutes for each presentation. 
* All group members must speak or have a role to play during the presentation.
* Content of the presentation must sufficiently address what is specified by the presentation prompt, but is not limited to it. Supplementary content that will help craft your argument is welcome, just ensure that your presentation falls within the 15-minute limit.
* Beyond the use of slide decks, you may leverage other techniques or tools to enhance student learning. The use of videos, class exercises, re-enactments, student volunteers, user interviews, surveys or other forms of media that can help strengthen your presentation is encouraged.
* Slide decks that were presented must be turned in via the relevant bCourses assignment page at the end of the class.

The presentations will be assessed according to the following criteria:

* Content (5 pts) - Did the presentation have valuable material that
  was relevant and beneficial to the class? Was it able to
  sufficiently address what was required by the prompt?
* Organization (5 pts) - Was the presentation well-structured,
  well-prepared and easy to follow?
* Delivery (5 pts) - Was the manner in which the presentation was
  delivered engaging enough, with sufficient confidence and
  preparedness?
* Participation (5 pts) - Did all team members contribute to the
  presentation and collaborate well with the team? (assessed by peer review)
