This is the course website for [Info 290M Lean/Agile Product Management](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290m-lapm), a three unit graduate class taught by [Jez Humble](https://continuousdelivery.com/about/talks/) at the UC Berkeley [School of Information](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/). Everything on this website is licensed [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/) unless otherwise noted.

The course is designed to give participants a practical overview of the modern lean/agile product management paradigm based on contemporary industry practice. We cover the complete lifecycle of product management, from discovering your customers and users through to building high performance teams and delivering complex digital products. We'll take an experimental approach throughout, showing how to minimize investment and output while maximizing the information we discover in order to support effective decision-making. During the course, we'll show how to apply the theory through hands-on collaborative problem-solving activities. There will also be guest lectures from industry experts.

Special thanks to [Carlos Miguel Lasa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmlasa) for his help designing and delivering this course.

# Pedagogy

Contemporary research into education tells us that the most effective way for students to learn is through doing, and by synthesizing material themselves in both an individual and group setting. Thus the majority of the material is learned through group and independent study through [assignments](/assignments-remote.html) and in-class exercises (but note group exercises in Fall 2020 will be done as group assignments), including case studies. There is also traditional lecture-style teaching, but this is designed to be interactive, and students are strongly encouraged to ask questions and engage with the material - although again in Fall 2020 due to the use of pre-recorded material this will happen in discussion sessions. Final [grades](/assignments-remote.html) are determined through continuous assessment, and there is no final exam.
