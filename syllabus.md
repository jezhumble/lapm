# Syllabus

LAPM is a one-semester course, taught in the form of 12-13 three-hour weekly classes, of which typically 2-3 are guest lectures. Nine of the ten remaining classes are detailed below. The final class is for final project presentations. 

## Unit 1. Introduction to the Product Lifecycle.

In our first class, we’ll discuss the various characteristics and types of products, paying particular attention to the product lifecycle. We’ll introduce the idea of a business model, and discuss the various risks that products might face in different parts of the product lifecycle. We’ll review a brief history of project and product management, and discuss the differences between the two.

Some guide questions that can help frame your response (no need to respond to all):

* What was your role in the exercise?
* How did your role change through the three rounds/iterations?
* Was your team able to successfully adapt using Agile methods?
* How could the team have performed better?

### Assignment

Create a user story map for one of the personas you created in your Unit 2 assignment. If you were excused from that assignment, feel free to use a project you're working on this semester and create a persona to use in this assignment.

Identify *three* activities the chosen persona might want to carry out with your software, and map out the activities, backbone, and tasks like we discussed this week in class. Expect to spend about an hour on this, not including reading the resources. You may use a tool of your choice to turn this in, such as turning in a PDF document or a URL to
an online tool such as [stickies.io](http://stickies.io) or [Trello](https://trello.com) (If using Trello, please add the course TA to your board.)

Please leverage the following resources (in addition to the readings for this week) in creating your user story map:

* Jeff Patton's [quick reference](http://jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/story_mapping.pdf)---start with Page 2. In this activity, I'm expecting you to carry out the first 3 steps listed on page 2: Frame, Map the big picture, Explore. I'm not expecting you to slice out releases or prepare a development strategy.
* [Chapter 1 of Jeff Patton's book](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/booksamplers/9781491904909_sampler.pdf) has an example of a story mapping exercise.
* Here's [another article](http://winnipegagilist.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-to-create-user-story-map.html) that you might find useful.

## Unit 6. Economic Frameworks for Portfolio and Product Management.

## Unit 9 - Case Study: Continuous Improvement

At heart, Lean is about working to create resilient, adaptive organizations. Crucially, the work of getting better is never done. In this class we’ll try out techniques for continuous improvement from the Lean management philosophy including retrospectives and the improvement kata, and discuss how to apply them in the context of product development.

### Guide questions for the case study:

* What strategies could the HP LaserJet team have employed to get firmware off the critical path? Why did they choose the approach they did?
* Imagine you were a product manager at HP working on products that used the LaserJet firmware during this rearchitecture. How would you have been impacted? What would you have to do differently? What would be keeping you awake at night?
