# Syllabus

LAPM is a one-semester course, taught in the form of 13 two-hour weekly classes, of which typically four are guest lectures. The remaining classes are detailed below.

## Week 1. Introduction to the Product Lifecycle.

In our first class, we’ll discuss the various characteristics and types of products, paying particular attention to the product lifecycle. We’ll introduce the idea of a business model, and discuss the various risks that products might face in different parts of the product lifecycle. We’ll review a brief history of project and product management, and discuss the differences between the two.

* [The New Methodology](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html) by Martin Fowler 

## Week 2. Economic Frameworks for Portfolio and Product Management.

This class presents the idea of using economic frameworks for portfolio and project management. We’ll begin with an overview of the three horizons model, and discuss the economic models that are suitable in each horizon. We’ll then discuss and experiment with economic tools that can be applied in each horizon, including the Value of Information, Monte Carlo and Cost of Delay.

## Week 8 - Case Study: Continuous Improvement

At heart, Lean is about working to create resilient, adaptive organizations. Crucially, the work of getting better is never done. In this class we’ll try out techniques for continuous improvement from the Lean management philosophy including retrospectives and the improvement kata, and discuss how to apply them in the context of product development.

Background Study:

* [HP LaserJet Firmware Case Study](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/leanenterprise/lean_enterprise_excerpt.pdf) -- pp112-127 from Chapter 6 (use printed page numbers!)
* Optional: Gary Gruver's [30m talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trqjj3d3lhQ) about the transformation.

Guide questions for the case study:

* What strategies could the HP LaserJet team have employed to get firmware off the critical path? Why did they choose the approach they did?
* Imagine you were a product manager at HP working on products that used the LaserJet firmware during this rearchitecture. How would you have been impacted? What would you have to do differently? What would be keeping you awake at night?

## Week 9 - The Role of the Product Manager

Our final class will cover what is expected of a product manager, including the skills, responsibilities and key activities product managers must perform.
