# Syllabus

LAPM is a one-semester course, taught in the form of 13 two-hour weekly classes, of which typically four are guest lectures. The remaining classes are detailed below.

## Unit 1. Introduction to the Product Lifecycle.

In our first class, we’ll discuss the various characteristics and types of products, paying particular attention to the product lifecycle. We’ll introduce the idea of a business model, and discuss the various risks that products might face in different parts of the product lifecycle. We’ll review a brief history of project and product management, and discuss the differences between the two.
